# Benchmarking Framework for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation

## Project : GRASPING OF UNKNOWN OBJECTS USING TOP SURFACES FROM A TABLE TOP 

Disclaimer: This repository contains benchmarking software designed to compare the performance of our research framework against classical approaches.  I would be happy to discuss more about the state-of-the-art research we are currently doing and the preliminary results we have achieved to date when the opportunity arises.
