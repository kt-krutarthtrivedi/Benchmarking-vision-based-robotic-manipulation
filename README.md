# Benchmarking Framework for Vision-Based Robotic Manipulation

Project : GRASPING OF UNKNOWN OBJECTS USING TOP SURFACES FROM A TABLE TOP 

Disclaimer: This repository contains the benchmarking software designed to compare the performance of our research framework against classical approaches. 
I would be happy to discuss more about the state-of-the-art research we are currently doing if given the opportunity.
